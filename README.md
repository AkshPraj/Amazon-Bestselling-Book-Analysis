To achieve the goal of this project, I have completed several tasks.

âœ… First, Download The Dataset from Kaggle.

âœ… Understanding the downloaded dataset properly.

âœ… Then I Checked whether the data sets contain null values, duplicates values, spaces, and special characters and cleaned it.

âœ… This Excel Sheet Contains Cleaned and Organized Data.

âœ… Add one columns in this data set. Created custom columns (Rating) to extract additional information from the dataset, with the help of IF Formulas.

âœ… Created Pivot tables, different Charts, and Graphs ðŸ“Š to summarise the data and visually get quick information and make it easier to understand.

âœ… Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel with inserting slicers, which allows users to interact with the data and view it in different ways.

## Key insights :

âœ… The book Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition: DSM- 5th being the most expensive

âœ… The highest number of average price happened in the year 2014.

âœ… if we analyse User Rating and price, user are satisfied with more affordable books. 

âœ… The highest average rating happened in the year 2019. This indicates a positive trend in user satisfaction, likely due to improvements in product quality, better customer service

âœ… There are more books with lower review counts than there are book with very high review counts. Suggesting right skewed distribution.
